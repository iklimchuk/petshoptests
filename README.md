# petshoptests
Source code.
You do not have to start selenium server/chromedriver manually, tests will do it automatically based on OS type.
Executable jar together with chromedriver and XMLs can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwBwBsbn-JKQOGl2WmpSd01tY00/view or built as an artifact from sources. It should have chromedrivers in the same folder and TestNG XMLs from resources. to run execute "java -jar petsshoptests.jar <XMLfile>"
